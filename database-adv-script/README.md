# Advanced Airbnb SQL Queries

## Overview
This project implements advanced SQL techniques using a simulated Airbnb schema. It covers joins, subqueries, aggregations, indexing, partitioning, and performance tuning.

## Directory Structure
- `joins_queries.sql`: SQL queries using INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs.
- `subqueries.sql`: Correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
- `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`: Aggregate functions and window operations.
- `database_index.sql`: Index creation scripts.
- `index_performance.md`: Performance analysis before and after indexing.
- `perfomance.sql`: Original complex query before optimization.
- `optimization_report.md`: Optimization strategies and outcomes.
- `partitioning.sql`: SQL to partition large tables.
- `partition_performance.md`: Results of partitioning performance tests.
- `performance_monitoring.md`: Monitoring logs and schema refinements.

## Tools Used
- MySQL/PostgreSQL
- EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE
